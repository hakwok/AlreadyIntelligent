## Abstract
Gambling isn't simply a game of chance—it’s about making the right decisions with limited information. This research aims to understand how a goal-based agent can be optimized for strategic decision-making in Poker betting games. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of three models: the Bayesian network, Hidden Markov models (HMM), and reinforcement learning, which enable the goal-based agent to improve game decision-making. These models will be tested on the Poker dataset from Kaggle, which contains game logs for each game, utilizing probabilistic reasoning and strategic adaptation. The agent operates in a partially observable dynamic environment, where performance is measured by win rates, expected long-term rewards, and adaptability. It senses relevant game-state information—such as player actions, tile distributions, and board changes—processing this data to select moves and optimize strategies. Insights from this research may inform the development of adaptive AI agents capable of strategic decision-making in other uncertain environments.
